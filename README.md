# Krav ZeroTrust
## *Full Contact ZeroTrust*

Krav means contact in Hebrew. Full contact ZT is an approach to ZeroTrust that focuses on practical real-world skills via the application of Krav Maga self-defense principles.

## Principles of Krav Zero Trust

**Employ Krav Maga’s** ***Retzev*** **- "Continuous Motion"**

Retzev is a concept that urges the Krav Maga practitioner to utilize and harness the natural power in movement throughout both **defensive** and **offensive** initiatives within a self-defense technique(s).

F**our Pillars of Krav Maga**

    1. Awareness
    2. Avoidance
    3. De-escalation and escape
    4. Last-resort decisive, simultaneous attack and defense

**THREATs**

    1. Technical Threats
    2. Health Threats
    3. Raids/Robbery Threats
    4. Environmental Threats
    5. Terrorism Threats

**Situational Awareness =** ***Mindfullness***
Situation awareness has been recognized as a critical, yet often elusive, foundation for successful decision-making across a broad range of situations, many of which involve the protection of human life and property, including law enforcement, aviation, air traffic control, ship navigation, health care, emergency response, military command and control operations, self defense, and offshore oil and nuclear power plant management. Lacking or inadequate situation awareness has been identified as one of the primary factors in accidents attributed to human error.

**The Five Levels of Situational Awareness:**

    - “Tuned Out” - Not paying attention.
    - “Relaxed Awareness” - Enjoying life while paying attention.
    - “Focused Awareness” - Carefully observing a perceived threat.
    - “High Alert” - Confirmed threat, must act.
    - “Comatose” - Not able to function.

## History of Krav Maga

Krav Maga is a military self-defence and fighting system developed for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israeli security forces derived from a combination of techniques sourced from Boxing, Wrestling, Judo, Aikido, and Karate. Krav Maga is known for its focus on **real-world situations** and its **extreme efficiency.** It was derived from the street-fighting experience of Hungarian-Israeli martial artist **Imi Lichtenfeld**, who made use of his training as a **boxer** and **wrestler**, while defending the Jewish quarter against fascist groups in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, during the mid-to-late 1930s. In the late 1940s, after his aliyah to Mandatory Palestine, he began to provide lessons on combat training to what was to become the IDF.


> **Krav Maga has a philosophy emphasizing aggression, and simultaneous defensive and offensive maneuvers.**
>

Some of the key focus is instinctive response under stress. To that end, Krav Maga is an **eclectic** system that has not sought to replace existing effective techniques, taking what is useful from available systems, for example:


- **Strikes** - as per karate, and boxing
- **Take-downs and throws** - per judo, akido and wrestling
- **Ground work** - per judo and wrestling
- **Escapes from chokes and holds** - per judo, akido, wrestling
- **Empty-hand weapon defenses** - per akido
